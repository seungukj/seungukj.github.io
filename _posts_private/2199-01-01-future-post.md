흥미로워 보이는 수학에 대한 저장고.

This is a warehouse of variety of links that I feel like interesting and worthwhile to keep the link.

 * [아르키메데스의 구 체적 찾기](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Apostol496-508.pdf) (How Archimedes found the volume of a sphere)
 * 3B1B series on [Newton fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) and [Holomorphic dynamics](https://youtu.be/LqbZpur38nw)
   * 뉴턴 프랙탈 관련(More on Newton fractals) [1](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/newton/) [2](https://blbadger.github.io/polynomial-roots.html)
 * Ravi Vakil's [picture book of exact sequences](https://math216.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/picturebook-aug-9-2021.pdf)

## noted from [WYM 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/wym2022/)
 * Krasner formula: counts the number of finite extensions over $$\mathbb{Q}_p$$ (p-adic number field). Relevant [MSE thread](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/78211), and a work of [Pauli and Roblot](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/publications/papers/krasner.pdf), esp. sec. 3 & 6.
 * Recent result about Manin--Mumford by [L. DeMarco, H. Krieger and H. Ye](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~demarco/UMMB.pdf)
 * [Nonarchimedean Sendor Conjecture, by Choi and Lee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11155)
 * A book by [Chari, Pressley](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/algebra/guide-quantum-groups?format=PB&isbn=9780521558846), _A guide to Quantum Groups_, Ch. 6 should contain some relevant information on "why QGs are defined like that."
 * A work of [Cineli, Ginzburg, and Gurel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03983) on "barcode entropy"

## How to make a properly synced local repo from my Github repos

 1. Start with an empty folder X.
 1. Run VS Code and open the folder X.
 1. At the initial *Welcome* tab, select Start > Clone Git Repository...
 1. If not logged into GitHub, then log in; if already done, select from my repos.
 1. The system will clone the repo. Once done, open it on the new thread. (This will practically ignore all other "blank projects" in the folder X.)
 1. Now enjoy committing and syncing this via remote repo.
