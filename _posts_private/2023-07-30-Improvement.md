A comment to [my recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11357), regarding an alternative model for describing the “holomorphic parameters” case.

# Summary of the work

Quite recently, I have uploaded [a work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11357) that focuses on some algebraic dynamics on an affine surface, called *Markov cubics*:

$$S_{ABCD}\colon X^2+Y^2+Z^2+XYZ=AX+BY+CZ+D,$$

where A, B, C, D are parameters.
