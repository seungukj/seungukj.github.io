A comment to [my recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11357), regarding an alternative model for describing the “holomorphic parameters” case.

# Summary of the work

Quite recently, I have uploaded [a work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11357) that focuses on some algebraic dynamics on an affine surface, called *Markov cubics*:

$$S_{ABCD}\colon X^2+Y^2+Z^2+XYZ=AX+BY+CZ+D,$$

where A, B, C, D are parameters. As seen in the equation, this surface is quadratic in each variable X, Y, and Z, hence defines involutions (called *Vieta involutions*) that 'flips' the quadratic solutions:

$$\begin{array}{rl}
s_1(X,Y,Z) &= (-YZ+A-X, Y, Z), \\
s_2(X,Y,Z) &= (X, -XZ+B-Y, Z), \\
s_3(X,Y,Z) &= (X, Y, -XY+C-Z).
\end{array}$$

Consider the group $\Gamma=\langle s_1,s_2,s_3\rangle$ generated by these involutions. Then we are interested in how Γ acts on the surface $S_{ABCD}$.

The main theorem of [(J. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11357) is about how Γ acts tropically on the surface.

 > 1. If one of the parameters A, B, C, D has a negative valuation, then there is an open dense invariant subset U in the skeleton whose Γ-action is conjugate to the $(\infty,\infty,\infty)$-triangle group action on the hyperbolic plane.
 > 1. If all of the parameters A, B, C, D have nonnegative valuations, then by spherically projecting the skeleton $(Sk\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\})/\R_{>0}$, the Γ-action is conjugate to the $(\infty,\infty,\infty)$-triangle group action on the **boundary** of the hyperbolic plane.

For the case if one of the parameters has a negative valuation (called *meromorphic parameters* in the paper), the picture goes like below. There, the claimed open subset U equals to the entire orbit of the triangle in the middle.

 If all of the parameters have nonnegative valuations (called *holomorphic parameters* in the paper), the picture goes as follows. Focus on the configuration of rays in the 'tropical' side and the configurations of vertices in the 'hyperbolic' side.

By far the results uses hyperbolic reflections and tessellations (called a *Farey tessellation*) to model the tropical action, but the way how we understand holomorphic parameters is "1-dimension lower" than the meromorphic case.
