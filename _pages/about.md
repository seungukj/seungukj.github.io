<!-- [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) -->

I am Seung uk Jang, a graduate student of Mathematics in the University of Chicago.

My advisors are [Alex Eskin](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/) and [Simion Filip](https://math.uchicago.edu/~sfilip/).

# Academic Interests
My primary mathematical interest is about dynamical systems, especially those on the complex spaces.

I am also interested with some mathematical logic, especially in the aspect of using mathematics to study the logics.

For my other miscellaneous math interests, check out [my blog](https://seungukj.github.io/year-archive/).
