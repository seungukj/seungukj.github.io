<!-- [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) -->

I am Seung uk Jang, a graduate student of Mathematics in the University of Chicago.

# Academic Interests
My primary mathematical interest is about dynamical systems, especially those on the complex spaces.

I am also interested with some mathematical logic, especially in the aspect of using mathematics to study the logics (e.g. Modal Logic). Other math subjects are of my interest, too!
