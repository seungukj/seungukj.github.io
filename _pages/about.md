<!-- [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) -->

I am Seung uk Jang, a post-doc in [IRMAR](https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/en), Universit√© de Rennes I.


# Academic Interests
My primary mathematical interest is about dynamical systems, especially those on the complex manifolds and their holomorphic automorphisms. Focusing on the algebraic cases of such classes, I am spreading my interest to observing similar traits for non-archimedean setups as well.

For my other miscellaneous math interests, check out [my blog](https://seungukj.github.io/blog/).
