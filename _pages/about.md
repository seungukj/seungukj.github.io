<!-- [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) -->

I am Seung uk Jang, a graduate student of Mathematics in the University of Chicago.

My advisors are [Alex Eskin](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/) and [Simion Filip](https://math.uchicago.edu/~sfilip/).

# Academic Interests
My primary mathematical interest is about dynamical systems, especially those on the complex manifolds and their holomorphic automorphisms.

To put it in more detail, I am interested in playing with compact Kähler manifolds $X$ that admits Ricci-flat metrics (by Yau, this is equivalent to: $c_1(X)=0$). The Ricci-flat metric and the natural Green current lets us to do some interesting analysis on these complex manifolds. My research interest stands on

 * dynamical consequences of such analysis on complex manifolds, and
 * study, by which extent, the study of complex manifolds generalize.

I am also interested with some mathematical logic, especially in the aspect of using mathematics to study the logics.
