A summary of the basics of the [Ruelle transfer operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_operator), along with some notes about how potentials work in the context of [Szilard's engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory#Szilard's_engine).


<!--
After the creation of [Maxwell's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon), some milestone discovery for its exorcism was made by [Szilard](https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01341281) and [Landauer](https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.53.0183). The latter pointed out that logically irreversible computation steps like memory erasure cause some heat dissipation, estimated theoretically as $k_BT\ln 2$ for a single binary bit. Alongside its experimental verification, e.g., [BÃ©rut et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10872), a recent work by [Vopson 2019](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5123794) suggests the *mass-energy-information equivalence principle*: Landauer's principle may be understood as that some 'information mass' $m=(k_B/c^2)T\ln 2$ is added to a binary memory bit that carries some information.

Apart from its physical reality, this note is to think about how [Ruelle transfer operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_operator) can be understood with the theory above. In particular, I would like to view the so-called 'potential function' as a prescribed maneuver of the 'information mass.'

# Definitions

Most of the definitions below are from [Ruelle 1992](https://doi.org/10.1088/0951-7715/5/6/002).

## Transfer Operator

Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space and $f\colon X\to X$ be a continuous map, which we call $(X,f)$ a *topological dynamical system*. We call a function $A\colon X\to\mathbb{R}$ a *potential*. Then we define an operator $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{f,A}$ as

$$(\mathcal{L}\omega)(x)=\sum_{y\in f^{-1}(x)}e^{A(y)}\omega(y),$$

for $\omega$ in a suitable function space on $X$. This operator $\mathcal{L}$ is called the **transfer operator** or the *Ruelle(-Perron-Frobenius) operator*.

If the domain of $\mathcal{L}$ contains continuous functions, then we think of its adjoint operator $\mathcal{L}^\ast$ acting on measures as well. If $f$ is differentiable, then we can set $A=-\log\vert J_f\vert$, where $J_f$ is the Jacobian of $f$, to get $\mathcal{L}^\ast=f_\ast$.

## Expansive, Specifications

We say a topological dynamical system $(X,f)$ is *expansive* and *has specifications* if it satisfies the following:

 * We say a system is **expansive** with expansive constant $C>0$ if $d(f^ix,f^iy)<C$ for all $i=0,1,2,\ldots$ implies $x=y$.
 * We say a system has **specifications** if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an integer $p=p(\epsilon)>0$ such that, given $\ell$ points $x_1,\ldots,x_\ell\in X$ and integers $n_1,\ldots,n_\ell>0$, $p_1,\ldots,p_{\ell-1}\geq p$, there exists $z\in X$ such that

$$d(f^{i+m(j-1)}z,f^ix_j)\leq\epsilon$$

for $i=0,\ldots,n_j-1$ and $j=1,\ldots,\ell$, where $m(j)=n_1+p_1+\cdots+n_j+p_j$.

Expansive means if two trajectories stay within a certain distance, then they must be the same. Having specifications means the list of points

$$x_1,fx_1,\ldots,f^{n_1-1}x_1,(\text{empty list of }p_1\text{ entries}), \\ x_2,fx_2,\ldots,f^{n_2-1}x_2,(\text{empty list of }p_2\text{ entries}), \\ \ldots,\ldots,x_\ell,fx_\ell,\ldots,f^{n_\ell-1}x_\ell$$

can be approximated by an orbit $(f^jz)_{j\geq 0}$ as long as the empty buffers are long enough.

Both properties reminisce some properties of Anosov diffeomorphisms.

## Bowen potential

This concept is mentioned by Ruelle but not named. The term 'Bowen property' is taken from other works, such as [Call 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00035) (see Definition 2.18).

Given a topological dynamical system $(X,f)$ and a potential $A\colon X\to\mathbb{R}$, we say $A$ has the *Bowen property at scale $\epsilon>0$* if

$$\sup\left\{\left\vert\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(A(f^kx)-A(f^ky))\right\vert : d(f^ix,f^iy)<\epsilon\quad\forall i=0,1,\ldots,n-1\right\}<\infty.$$

If $(X,f)$ is expansive, then we say a potential $A$ has the **Bowen property** if it has the Bowen property at the expansive constant.

## Gibbs measure

Let $U\subset X$ be a compact subset and $\varphi\colon U\to\varphi(U)\subset X$ be a homeomorphism onto its image. We say a pair $(U,\varphi)$ is a *conjugating homeomorphism* if for each $x\in U$ we have $\lim_{k\to\infty}d(f^kx,f^k\varphi x)=0$.

Let $A$ be a potential that is Bowen. We say a probability measure $\mu\in\mathcal{M}^1(X)$ is a *Gibbs state* for $A$ if for any conjugating homeomorphism $(U,\varphi)$, we have

$$\frac{d\varphi_\ast\mu}{d\mu} = \exp\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty(A\circ f^k\circ\varphi^{-1}-A\circ f^k)\right]. \label{eqn:gibbs-measure} $$

That is if we say

$$\mathcal{E}\{A\}=\exp\left[-\sum_{k=0}^\infty A\circ f^k\right],$$

then the criterion \eqref{eqn:gibbs-measure} is formally rewritten

$$\mathcal{E}\{A\}\circ\varphi^{-1}\, d\varphi_\ast\mu = \mathcal{E}\{A\}\, d\mu, \label{eqn:gibbs-measure-formal}$$

although the convergence of $$\mathcal{E}\{A\}$$ is not guaranteed so the expression \eqref{eqn:gibbs-measure-formal} is just formal.

## Topological Pressure

Let $(X,f)$ be a topological dynamical system. Let $\mu$ be an invariant probability Radon measure. Its *measure-theoretic entropy* or *Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy* is denoted $h_\mu(f)$; for its definition, refer to [Scholarpedia](http://dx.doi.org/10.4249/scholarpedia.2034), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure-preserving_dynamical_system#Measure-theoretic_entropy), or standard textbooks like [Walter 1982](https://link.springer.com/book/9780387951522). Recall also that $\mu\mapsto h_\mu(f)$ is affine (i.e., $h_{(1-p)\mu+p\nu}(f)=(1-p)h_\mu(f)+ph_\nu(f)$); see [Walter 1982](https://link.springer.com/book/9780387951522), Theorem 8.1.

Denote $\mathcal{M}(X)^f$ for the space of invariant probability Radon measures on $X$. This forms a convex set, and the negentropy map $\mu\mapsto -h_\mu(f)$ is a convex function on it. Therefore one can think of its [convex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate)

$$P(\phi) = \sup_{\mu\in\mathcal{M}(X)^f}\left(\int_X\phi\, d\mu + h_\mu(f)\right),\label{eqn:measure-theoretic-pressure}$$

which is called the **topological pressure** of $(X,f,\mu)$ by the potential $\phi$. We say $\mu\in\mathcal{M}(X)^f$ an **equilibrium state** for $A$ if the supermum is attained at $\mu$.

It obviously follows that $P(\phi)$ is convex in $\phi$, and $P(0)=h_{\mathrm{top}}(f)$ is the topological entropy.

By the natural duality of measures and continuous functions, $\phi$ is morally a continuous function. But I will also abuse the notations and think of $P(\phi)$ for measurable functions, whenever defined. For instance, Bowen potentials well-define the pressure.

### Walter's Theorem

[Walter 1975](https://doi.org/10.2307/2373682), Theorem 4.1 proves the *variational principle* for topological pressures defined with separating sets. This compares the topological pressures, defined with the measure-theoretic definition \eqref{eqn:measure-theoretic-pressure} and the topological definition \eqref{eqn:topology-pressure} stated below.

Given a topological dynamical system $(X,f)$, we say a finite set $E\subset X$ is *$(\epsilon,n)$-separated* if any distinct $x,y\in E$ has $d(f^ix,f^iy)>\epsilon$ for all $i=0,1,\ldots,n-1$. Then we define

$$P(\phi,\epsilon,n)=\sup\left\{\sum_{x\in E}\exp\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\phi(f^ix)\right) : E\text{ is }(\epsilon,n)\text{-separated}\right\}, \\
P(\phi,\epsilon)=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac1n\log P(\phi,\epsilon,n),$$

and

$$P(\phi)=\sup_{\epsilon>0}P(\phi,\epsilon).\label{eqn:topology-pressure}$$

This reminds us of the [definition of topological entropy using separated sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_entropy#Definition_of_Bowen_and_Dinaburg), especially when $\phi\equiv 0$. Walter's theorem states that definitions \eqref{eqn:measure-theoretic-pressure} and \eqref{eqn:topology-pressure} coincide.

## Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius Theorem

[Ruelle](https://doi.org/10.1088/0951-7715/5/6/002) then proved the following.

 > **Theorem** (Ruelle 1992). Let $(X,f)$ be a topological dynamical system that is expansive and has specifications. Given a Borel function $A$ that has the Bowen property, the following hold.
 >
 > 1. There is a unique equilibrium state $\rho$ for $A$.
 > 1. There is a unique Gibbs state $\mu$ for $A$, which satisfies the following eigen-measure property:
 >
 > $$\mathcal{L}^\ast\mu = e^{P(A)}\mu.$$
 > 3. There is a unique $\Phi\in L^1(\mu)$ such that $\rho=\Phi\mu$, and $\Phi$ is (up to a constant) the only eigenfunction of $\mathcal{L}$ acting on $L^1(\mu)$, which is positive and $\log\Phi\in L^\infty(\mu)$:
 >
 > $$\mathcal{L}\Phi = e^{P(A)}\Phi.$$
 >
 > 4. Let $\Psi\in L^p(\mu)$, $1\leq p<\infty$. Then we have, in $L^p(\mu)$,
 >
 > $$\lim_{n\to\infty}e^{-nP(A)}\mathcal{L}^n\left(\Psi-\Phi\cdot\int_X\Psi\,d\mu\right)=0.$$

The importance of the result cannot be overemphasized, so I will point out only a piece of it: topological pressure is seen as the logarithm of the 'Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue' of the transfer operator.

# Transfer Operators on Shift Spaces

To study the definitions above further, we study what happens to the definitions for the space $$X=\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$$ of full shifts (here, our natural number set $$\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$$ consists of positive integers). We denote an element $$\left(x_i\right)_{i=1}^\infty\in X$$ as digits after a point, $$.x_1x_2x_3\cdots$$.

Perhaps we can append some alphabets in front of $x\in X$. Such elements will be denoted $.0x$, $.1011x$, etc.

The natural dynamics that the shift X carries is the shift map,

$$\sigma\colon X\to X \\ \sigma(.x_1x_2x_3\cdots)=.x_2x_3\cdots.$$

To describe the topology, we denote the *cylinder set* as $C(.0)$, $C(.0\mathrm{x}1)$, etc. That is, given a finite string in 0, 1, and x, we collect elements of the shift X that follows the pattern (where x is interpreted as 'free'). So for instance,

$$C(.0) = \{x\in X : x_1=0\}, \\ C(.0\mathrm{x}1)=\{x\in X : x_1=0,\ x_3=1\}.$$

We fix any number $0<\theta<1$ and define the metric on X by

$$d(x,y) = \max\{\theta^j : x_j\neq y_j\}.$$

By this metric, the shift system $(X,\sigma)$ is expansive (with constant $\theta$) and has specifications.

## Zero potential

Denote $$\mathcal{L}_0$$ for the transfer operator with the zero potential $A\equiv 0$. That is, $$\mathcal{L}_0\omega(x)=\sum_{y\colon\sigma(y)=x}\omega(y)=\omega(.0x)+\omega(.1x)$$. A picture for this action may be sketched as follows.

![visual-transfer-operator](/images/230111-fig1.png)

That is, we think of restrictions $\omega\vert C(.0)$ and $\omega\vert C(.1)$, "stretch the domains" (by the shift map $\sigma$) for each, and add them up to find $$\mathcal{L}_0\omega$$.

 > <font style="font-style:normal">A handy way to discover this is to try evaluating $\mathcal{L}_0\omega$ for some 'sample continuous functions' $\omega=\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)},\mathbf{1}_{C(.01)}-\mathbf{1}_{C(.00)}$, etc. Such combinations of indicator functions are easy to sketch and easy to trace their contributions, thus the pictorial interpretation above.</font>

If we think $\omega$ as a mass distribution over $X$, then $$\mathcal{L}_0\omega$$ is the new mass distribution obtained by acting the shift $\sigma$ to the space $X$. 
As we do not normalize the mass after the procedure, it is easy to guess that overall mass doubles after each step, and there seems no additional 'concentration of mass' that exhibits an increase of mass of more than two times. Thus we guess that the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue is 2. Indeed this matches with $$h_{\mathrm{top}}(X,\sigma)=\log 2$$.

## Bernoulli Potential

Next, we think of the potential $$A=\beta\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)}$$, where $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real parameter. That is, we have $A(x)=\beta$ if $x\in C(.0)$, and $A(x)=0$ otherwise. Call $$\mathcal{L}_\beta$$ for the corresponding transfer operator.

In that case $$\mathcal{L}_\beta\omega(x)=e^\beta\omega(.0x)+\omega(.1x)$$, so it does a similar job as the zero potential cases, except that it emphasizes (or dismisses, if $\beta<0$) mass located at the cylinder $C(.0)$. The process multiplies the mass by $(e^\beta+1)$, so just as the $$\mathcal{L}_0$$ case, we guess the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of $$\mathcal{L}_\beta$$ as that multiple.

Indeed, the sequence $$(e^\beta+1)^{-n}\mathcal{L}_\beta^n\omega$$, where $\omega$ is the indicator function of a cylinder set of $X$, converges to the constant function $$\int_X\omega\, d\mu_\beta$$, where $\mu_\beta$ is the Bernoulli measure defined as follows.

 > For any cylinder $C(.s)$, let $\vert s\vert_0,\vert s\vert_1$ be the number of 0's and 1's appearing in $s$, respectively. Let $p=(1+e^{-\beta})^{-1}$. Then we define
 > 
 > $$\mu_\beta(C(.s))=\binom{\vert s\vert_0+\vert s\vert_1}{\vert s\vert_0}p^{\vert s\vert_0}\left(1-p\right)^{\vert s\vert_1}.$$

This verifies that $$\mathcal{L}_\beta$$ has the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue $(e^\beta+1)$, the eigenfunction 1, and the eigenmeasure (which is a Gibbs measure; consider the homeomorphism fixing a digit $C(.0)\to C(.1)$) $$\mu_\beta$$ which is the Bernoulli measure above. The eigenmeausre is also the equilibrium measure for the potential $$A=\beta\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)}$$, and thus the pressure is

$$P(\beta\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)})=p\beta+p\log\frac1p+(1-p)\log\frac1{1-p}=\log(e^\beta+1), \label{eqn:pressure-logZ}$$

where $p=(1+e^{-\beta})^{-1}$.

<!--

## Transitions

Another typical example where the transfer operator gets attention is the *subshift of finite type* (SFT). Let $$X=\{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}^{\mathbb{N}}$$ be a full shift of k alphabets. Let $S$ be a set of finite strings of length $j$, by alphabets $a_1,\ldots,a_k$. (Say, $$S=\{a_1a_1,a_1a_2,a_1a_3,a_2a_3,a_3a_1\}$$ has $j=2$ and $k=3$.)

The SFT by $S$ is denoted $X_S$ and is defined as follows. Here, $x[i:j]:=x_{i+1}x_{i+2}\cdots x_j$ for $x\in X$.

$$X_S = \{x\in X : (\forall i\geq 0)(x[i:i+j]\in S)\}.$$

This set could be empty, but it is always closed in $X$.

Now we assign a 'log weight' $\tau\colon S\to\mathbb{R}$ on the set S of string patterns. This naturally defines a potential $A(x)=\tau(x[0:j])$ on $X_S$, and thus a transfer operator as well.

# Szilard's Engine, Boltzmann Distribution

## The Engine

Here is an attempt to relate the topological pressure with Szilard's engine. (Figure from [Leff & Rex 2002](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0750307595))

![Fig1.9-of-Leff-Rex](/images/230111-fig2.png)

*Szilard's engine* is an ideal model of an information engine, that consists of a chamber that has one particle of an ideal gas (fig. (a)); thus the state equation $\beta VP=1$, where $\beta=1/(k_BT)$ is the inverse temperature. The cyclic operation of the engine is described as follows.

The chamber of the engine is first partitioned into two (equal) parts, and one observes at which partition the particle land (fig. (b)). Based on that information, one turns the partition into a piston (fig. (c)). One then receives heat from the heat bath to run the piston (fig. (d)). By this, we come back to the initial stage (fig. (a)).

Hence during the cycle, we see that the machine turns heat energy $Q$ to some work $W$ for free, modulo any changes made during the observation. But one also needs to be clear that in fig. (b), we have changed from a state with two possibilities ($S=k_B\log 2$) to a state with one possibility ($S=0$). By this, we have discovered some entropy change that was not found when we only traced thermodynamical works (cf. [a video lecture](https://youtu.be/GlsdAaMb2H4?t=4416), in Japanese), which compensates the apparent paradoxical entropy reduction.

## Variant 1

Consider a modification of Szilard's engine that partitions the chamber *unevenly*, say $p:(1-p)$ in volume. But regardless of which partition the particle land, we can estimate the work done by the particle during  the isothermal process:

$$W=\int_i^fP\, dV=\int_i^f\frac{dV}{\beta V}=\frac1\beta\log\frac{V_f}{V_i}.$$

Now we estimate the work $W$ case-by-case.

 * If the particle is observed in the left partition, then the amount of work exerted is

 $$W(L)=\frac1\beta\log\frac{V_f}{V_i}=\frac1{\beta}\log\frac{V_{\mathrm{cham}}}{pV_{\mathrm{cham}}}=\frac1{\beta}\log\frac1p.$$

 * If the particle is observed in the right partition, then the amount of work exerted is

 $$W(R)=\frac1\beta\log\frac{V_f}{V_i}=\frac1\beta\log\frac{V_{\mathrm{cham}}}{(1-p)V_{\mathrm{cham}}}=\frac1\beta\log\frac1{1-p}.$$

Averaging the two, we have

$$\langle W\rangle=W(L)\Pr(L)+W(R)\Pr(R)=\frac1\beta\left(p\log\frac1p+(1-p)\log\frac1{1-p}\right),$$

and thus

$$S=\beta\langle W\rangle=p\log\frac1p+(1-p)\log\frac1{1-p}$$

is recovering the binary Shannon entropy.

## Variant 2

Suppose we are building our chamber with a flexible material, so that the chamber may expand one of its partitions to reach the equilibrium. (We initially partition the chamber evenly in volume.)

![Szilard-with-external-E](/images/230111-fig3.png)

To elaborate, we run the engine as follows. If the particle exists at the left side, add some energy $\epsilon$ to the particle. Using that energy, let the particle isothermally expand. (If the particle exists at the right side, do not add energy, but expand the left chamber $$V_f=e^{\beta\epsilon}V_i$$ anyways.)

To estimate the final volume after the expansion $V_i\to V_f$, we think that the energy $\epsilon$ received is completely turned into the work, thus

$$\epsilon=W=\int_i^fP\, dV=\frac1\beta\log\frac{V_f}{V_i}.$$

Hence

$$V_f = e^{\beta\epsilon}V_i.$$

By this, we reduce to the uneven volume case, with the volume ratio $e^{\beta\epsilon}:1$. (Observe that the expression reminds us of the Boltzmann distribution, modulo some sign conventions.)

Furthermore, running the remaining steps of the engine we see that the total amount of work done is estimated as follows.

 * If the particle exists at the left partition, then

 $$W_{\mathrm{tot}}(L)=\epsilon+\frac1\beta\log\frac{1+e^{\beta\epsilon}}{e^{\beta\epsilon}}=\frac1\beta\log(1+e^{\beta\epsilon}).$$

 * If the particle exists at the right partition, then

 $$W_{\mathrm{tot}}(R)=\frac1\beta\log\frac{1+e^{\beta\epsilon}}1=\frac1\beta\log(1+e^{\beta\epsilon}).$$

 So $\langle W\rangle=\beta^{-1}\log(1+e^{\beta\epsilon})$ and $S=\log(1+e^{\beta\epsilon})$ follows.

If we understand that this $\epsilon$ is taking the role of potential $$\beta\epsilon\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)}$$ in the transfer operator over a symbolic system, the entropy computed above is precisely the topological pressure $$P(\beta\epsilon\mathbf{1}_{C(.0)})=\log(1+e^{\beta\epsilon})$$ that we have found in \eqref{eqn:pressure-logZ}.

<!-- In case a potential $A\colon X\to\mathbb{R}$ is fixed, one may get interested in pressure $P(\beta A)$ with inverse temperature $\beta=(kT)^{-1}$. In that case, $\beta\mapsto P(\beta A)$ is a convex function. -->
