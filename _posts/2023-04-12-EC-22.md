One way to see an elliptic curve is to view it as a smooth bidegree (2,2) curve in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. This fact itself comes from the [adjunction formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunction_formula), but we suggest a way to derive a bidegree (2,2) formula from the Weierstrass equation. Based on that, we see how this connects with the tropicalized actions of Vieta involutions on elliptic curves.

### Note on the Setup

All fields below are algebraically closed and has characteristic 0. This enables use to prove algebro-geometric claims by just looking at complex numbers (thanks to the completeness of the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0).

# Bidegree (2,2) curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$

A simple computation using [adjunction formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunction_formula) reveals that any *smooth* bidegree (2,2) curve X in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ has trivial canonical bundle. That is, if we write $H_1,H_2$ for divisors of $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ given as $\ast\times\mathbb{P}^1$ and $\mathbb{P}^1\times\ast$ respectively (here $\ast$ is meant to be any point in $\mathbb{P}^1$), then the canonical bundle of X is computed as

$$\begin{array}{rl}K_X &= (K_{\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1}+X)|_X \\
&= (-2H_1-2H_2+(2H_1+2H_2))|_X \\ &= 0. \end{array}$$

So $H^0(X,K_X)=H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X)=1=g$ tells that X has genus 1, i.e., is an elliptic curve.

One problem is that, it is hard to find a bidegree (2,2) curve *which is smooth* by just looking at cheap guesses. For instance, consider $\phi=0$ where

$$\phi(x,x'):=Ax^2+Bxx'+C(x')^2+Dx+Ex'+F,$$

and $x,x'$ are respectively affine coordinates of the first and second factor of $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. In that case, if we flip the coordinates to $y=1/x$ and $y'=1/x'$ and consider

$$(yy')^2\phi(1/y,1/y')=A(y')^2+Byy'+Cy^2+Dy(y')^2+Ey^2y'+F(yy')^2=0,$$

then this curve is singular at $(y,y')=0$. So to avoid such a tragedy, we need to add $x^2x',x(x')^2,(xx')^2$ terms into the polynomial $\phi$, making the verification that "$\phi=0$ is smooth" more complicated. Say, who would be happy to tune the parameters $a_{ij}$, $0\leq i,j\leq 2$ (from the scratch) such that

$$\sum_{0\leq i,j\leq 2}a_{ij}x^i(x')^j=0, \\ 2x\sum_{j=0}^2a_{2j}(x')^j + \sum_{j=0}^2a_{1j}(x')^j=0, \\ 2x'\sum_{i=0}^2a_{i2}x^i + \sum_{i=0}^2a_{i1}x^i=0$$

derives a contradiction?

## Weierstrass Form, Weierstrass ℘

It is also known that any elliptic curve X can be embedded into $\mathbb{P}^2$, whose image is the curve with the equation, called [Weierstrass form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve#Elliptic_curves_over_the_real_numbers),

$$y^2=x^3+Ax+B$$

on the affine chart $[x:y:1]\in\mathbb{P}^2$. We also recall the group structure on elliptic curves, which is based on sketching lines between points in X. Checking this is quite standard (see, e.g., [Silverman 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6) Sec. III.3), but the fact has more complex analytic significance.

It is also known that, if an elliptic curve is defined over $\mathbb{C}$, its complex points form a torus (see, e.g., [Silverman 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6) Sec. VI.1) of complex dimension 1. So if we let $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{C}$ to be a lattice (a discrete copy of $\mathbb{Z}^2$) then $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ describes the complex points of an elliptic curve. Not only that, we have the [Weierstrass ℘-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_elliptic_function)

$$\wp\colon\mathbb{C}/\Lambda\to\widehat{\mathbb{C}}(=:\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}=\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}))$$

which satisfies

$$(\wp'(z))^2=4(\wp(z))^3-60G_4(\Lambda)\wp(z)-140G_6(\Lambda),$$

where $G_4,G_6$ are Eisenstein series on the lattice (treat them as some special functions of $\Lambda$). It is known that the map

$$[\wp:\wp':1]\colon\mathbb{C}/\Lambda\to\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$$

is injective and its image is precisely the curve $(y^2=4x^3-60G_4x-140G_6)\subset\mathbb{P}^2$. For sake of distinguishing, we name the map

$$i:=[\wp:\wp':1]$$

and its image curve as

$$E\colon y^2=4x^3-60G_4x-140G_6.$$

 > Any careful reader may notice that $i(0)$ is not well-defined just by what was written above. To get over this, we use that $\wp(z)=z^{-2}+O(z^{-1})$ and $\wp'(z)=-2z^{-3}+O(z^{-2})$, so that
 >
 > $$[\wp:\wp':1]=[z^{-2}+O(z^{-1}):-2z^{-3}+O(z^{-2}):1] \\ =[z+O(z^2):-2+O(z):z^3]$$
 >
 > near $z=0$. Plugging in 0, we then have $i(0)=[0:-2:0]=[0:1:0]$.

One nice aspect of this embedding is that it respects the group law on the elliptic curve. More precisely,

 * three points $P,Q,R\in E(\mathbb{C})$ form an intersection of a line with $E$ iff $P=i(z_1),Q=i(z_2),R=i(z_3)$ satisfies $z_1+z_2+z_3=0$, and
  * $i(0)=[0:1:0]$.
  
Hence we have $i(z_1)\oplus i(z_2)=i(z_1+z_2)$, where ⊕ denotes the group operation on $E$.

 > A relevant interesting exercise is to verify the determinant

 > $$\begin{vmatrix} \wp(z_1) & \wp'(z_1) & 1 \\ \wp(z_2) & \wp'(z_2) & 1 \\ \wp(-z_1-z_2) & \wp'(-z_1-z_2) & 1 \end{vmatrix}=0,$$
 >
 > which can be shown by fixing $z_2$ and computing the pole order with respect to $z_1$. Of course there is a proof of above facts using more elegant methods (see [Silverman 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6) Prop. VI.3.6).

## Geometric description of ℘

Note that Weierstrass ℘-function is, over complex numbers, a map from a torus $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ to a sphere $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$. Furthermore, the ℘-function is an even function, and that evenness is the only source of non-injectivity; i.e., one has a

 > <b id="lem1">Lemma 1.</b> We have $\wp(z)=\wp(z')$ iff either $z=z'$ or $z=-z'$.

(Proof) The 'if' part comes from evenness of ℘. For 'only if,' let $x_0=\wp(z)=\wp(z')$ and $z\neq z'$. On $\mathbb{P}^2$, $i(z)$ and $i(z')$ stay on the line $x=x_0$ which passes through the point $[0:1:0]=i(0)$. Therefore $z+z'+0=0$. $\square$

The proof is motivated by the observation that the function ℘ works as the "x-coordinate" of the elliptic curve (in its Weierstrass form), the following is clear from the sketch of Weierstrass form elliptic curves [figure source-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve#/media/File:ECClines-3.svg):

![EC-weierstrass](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/ECClines-3.svg/1920px-ECClines-3.svg.png)

Having this observation on hand, one can geometrically describe the map of ℘ asthe natural quotient $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda\to(\mathbb{C}/\Lambda)/(z\sim-z)$ by antipodal points. The figure below describes a 'pillowcase' description of this quotient map.

![pillowcase](/images/230412-fig3.png)

Another way to interpret this is to think ℘ as the quotient by a hyperelliptic involution. To describe the involution, we draw a line through a torus and rotate the torus by 180 degrees (hoping that we come back to the torus by doing so). If we identify points under this rotation then we form a sphere with four special points. [figure source-Kashyap Rajeevsarathy](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-hyperelliptic-involution-on-a-torus_fig1_343333685)

![The hyperelliptic involution on a torus.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kashyap-Rajeevsarathy/publication/343333685/figure/fig1/AS:919203716554752@1596166652524/The-hyperelliptic-involution-on-a-torus.png)

Now there is no reason to not consider other lines that can build hyperelliptic involutions, or their quotients. So consider $a\in\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, and consider the function $z\mapsto\wp(z+a)$. Then $\wp(z)$ and $\wp(z+a)$ gives two hyperelliptic involutions on the torus:

![other-line](/images/230412-fig2.png)

For most choices of $a\in\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, these involutions give an embedding of the torus into $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$.

 > <b id="lem2">Proposition 2.</b> Let $a\in\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$. Consider the map
 >
 > $$\begin{array}{rl} \Phi_a\colon \mathbb{C}/\Lambda &\to (\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1)(\mathbb{C}), \\ z &\mapsto(\wp(z),\wp(z+a)). \end{array}$$
 >
 > This map injects iff $a\notin\frac12\Lambda/\Lambda$.

 (Proof) We show the contrapositive. If $a\in\frac12\Lambda/\Lambda$, then we have $\Phi_a(a)=\Phi_a(-a)$, so either $\Phi_a$ is not injective or $a=0$. But if $a=0$ then $\Phi_a$ is an even map which cannot be injective still.

 If $\Phi_a(z)=\Phi_a(z')$ with $z\neq z'$, we have $z+z'=0$ and $(z+a)+(z'+a)=0$ by the above [Lemma 1](#lem1). But then $2a=0$, so $a\in\frac12\Lambda/\Lambda$. $\square$

## From Weierstrass form to Bidegree (2,2) form

The [Proposition 2](#lem2) suggests an embedding of elliptic curves into $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ by hyperelliptic quotients. In fact this map can be described algebraically as follows. First, we fix a Weierstrass form

$$E\colon y^2=x^3+Ax+B.$$

![phi-a](/images/230412-fig1.png)

Fix a point $A=[\alpha:\beta:1]\in E$. For a point $P=[x:y:1]\in E$, define $Q=[x':y':1]\in E$ to be the third point so that $A,P,Q$ form an intersection of a line with $E$. Then define the map

$$\Psi\colon P\in E\mapsto (x,x')\in\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1.$$

Over the complex numbers, this coincides with the map $i\circ\Phi_{i^{-1}A}\circ i^{-1}$. Hence $\Psi$ is injective, as long as $2A\neq O$, or equivalently, $A\neq O$ and $\beta\neq 0$.

To study the image $\Psi(E)\subset\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$, we note that (see [Silverman 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6) Algorithm III.2.3(d))

$$\alpha+x+x'=\left(\frac{\beta-y}{\alpha-x}\right)^2. \label{eqn:x'-formula}$$

(There may be some issues regarding double points, but we ignore them for our computation now.) Note that, by collinearlity, we have

$$\frac{\beta-y}{\alpha-x}=\frac{\beta-y'}{\alpha-x'}=\frac{y-y'}{x-x'},$$

hence

$$\alpha+x+x'=\left(\frac{\beta-y'}{\alpha-x'}\right)^2. \label{eqn:x-formula}$$

Now we aim to get rid of $y,y'$ from \eqref{eqn:x'-formula}\eqref{eqn:x-formula}, to find a pure relation between $x,x'$. (We treat $\alpha,\beta$ as constants, as the point $A$ is fixed.)

Multiply $(\alpha-x)^2$ on both sides of \eqref{eqn:x'-formula}, and expand $(\beta-y)^2$. Then we have

$$\beta^2+y^2-2\beta y = (\alpha-x)^2(\alpha+x+x').$$

If we replace $y^2=x^3+Ax+B$, then the cubic term $x^3$ are monic on both sides, letting us to cancel them out. Thus we have

$$-2\beta y = -\beta^2-Ax-B-\alpha x^2-\alpha^2 x+\alpha^3+x'(\alpha-x)^2.$$

Likewise, from \eqref{eqn:x-formula} we have

$$-2\beta y'=-\beta^2-Ax'-B-\alpha(x')^2-\alpha^2x'+\alpha^3+x(\alpha-x')^2.$$

Hence

$$-2\beta\frac{y-y'}{x-x'}=-A-2\alpha^2-\alpha(x+x')+xx',$$

and squaring both sides we have

$$4\beta^2(\alpha+x+x')=(xx'-\alpha(x+x')-A-2\alpha^2)^2. \label{eqn:22-embedding}$$

A bit of further algebra indicates that the relation \eqref{eqn:22-embedding} is defining a bidegree (2,2) curve in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$.

 > <b id="lem3">Proposition 3.</b> The curve defined by the equation \eqref{eqn:22-embedding} is smooth and equals to the image curve $\Psi(E)\subset\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$.

(Proof) Call $C\subset\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ for the curve defined by \eqref{eqn:22-embedding}. By the derivation, we have $\Psi(E)\subset C$.

Next, we claim that $\Psi$ is smooth and locally injective, which means for all point $P\in E$ we have $D_P\Psi\colon T_PE\to T_{\Psi(P)}\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ injective. Recall the points $A=[\alpha:\beta:1]$, $P=[x:y:1]$ and $Q=[x':y':1]$. If one explicitly writes down $T_PE=\mathbb{C}.(2y\partial_x+(3x^2+A)\partial_y)$ and its image $(2y\partial_x+2y'\partial_{x'})\in T_{(x,x')}\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ (assume $P\neq O,-A$), then the required injectivity boils down to $y\neq 0\vee y'\neq 0$. This criterion, together with $2A\neq O$ for the injectivity when $P=O,-A$, forms a purely algebraic statement. Over complex numbers, this holds since $\Phi_{i^{-1}A}$ is smooth and (locally) injective, so is $\Psi$ over general fields.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Thus both $\Psi(E),C$ have dimensions 1, and furthermore $\Psi(E)$ is smooth (cf. [Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01V4), Lem. 29.34.19, with $S$ the Spec of the base field).

So it suffices to show that $C$ is irreducible. Note that the polynomial

$$F(x')=(xx'-\alpha(x+x')-A-2\alpha^2)^2-4\beta^2(\alpha+x+x')$$

over the polynomial ring of $x$ is irreducible iff $C$ is irreducible. This irreducibility is established if we have the discriminant

$$\begin{array}{rl}\Delta &= \left[(A+2\alpha^2+\alpha x)(x-\alpha)+2\beta^2\right]^2 \\&\qquad-(x-\alpha)^2\left[(A+2\alpha^2+\alpha x)^2-4\beta^2(\alpha+x)\right]\end{array}$$

*not* a perfect square. One can check that $\Delta$ is a cubic polynomial, whose cubic term is $4\beta^2x^3$ (which is never zero since $2A\neq O$). So counting the degrees, we see that our discriminant is not a perfect square. $\square$

<sup id="fn1">1. This argument is based on the model theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. If a statement is 'purely algebraic,' i.e., can be stated with constants from $\mathbb{C}$ and $+,-,\cdot$, its truth on $\mathbb{C}$ (which can be proven with whichever methods convenient) implies the truth on any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

# Dynamics of Involutions

The bidegree (2,2) form \eqref{eqn:22-embedding},

$$4\beta^2(\alpha+x+x')=(xx'-\alpha(x+x')-A-2\alpha^2)^2,$$

is a quadratic equation in $x,x'$ if we fix $x',x$ respectively. So there are natural algebraic involutions, *Vieta involutions*, that flip the two quadratic solutions. More concretely, one has maps

$$s_x(x,x') = \left(\frac{2(A+2\alpha^2+\alpha x')(x'-\alpha)+4\beta^2}{(x'-\alpha)^2}-x,x'\right), \\ s_{x'}(x,x') = \left(x,\frac{2(A+2\alpha^2+\alpha x)(x-\alpha)+4\beta^2}{(x-\alpha)^2}-x'\right)$$

acting on $\Psi(E)\subset\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ (cf. [Proposition 3](#lem3)). 

If we see this on complex numbers, the actions have a fairly nice visualizations. Note first that $s_x$ acts as the deck action on the 2-to-1 cover $x\colon E\to\mathbb{P}^1$ (note that $x$ is ℘ times some scale factor). Likewise, the 2-to-1 cover $x'\colon E\to\mathbb{P}^1$ has the deck action $s_{x'}$ (note that $x'$ is $\wp(z+a)$ times some scale factor).

It turns out that both involutions $s_x,s_{x'}$ are hyperelliptic involutions. On the torus $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, we may express $s_x(z)=-z$ and $s_{x'}(z)=-2a-z$. These maps can be expressed by the figure below.

![other-line](/images/230412-fig2.png)

On the picture above, the axis with $\wp(z)$ passes the points in $\frac12\Lambda/\Lambda$, which are fixed under $s_x$. The axis with $\wp(z+a)$ passes the points in $-a+\frac12\Lambda/\Lambda$, which are fixed under $s_{x'}$. Now if we contract the [meridian curve](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/T/torus.html) (more precisely, a simple closed curve transverse to the line $\mathbb{R}.(-a)$), we get two reflections on a circle.

If $a$ is a torsion element of order q≠2, then the orbit of a point by $s_x,s_{x'}$ forms a regular q-gon, and the involutions generate the dihedral group of the regular q-gon. Otherwise, we have an infinite dihedral group, which is the free product of order 2 groups $\langle s_x\rangle$ and $\langle s_{x'}\rangle$.

Such a 'geometric simplificiation' trick is captured by tropicalizations. If we tropicalize bidegree (2,2) curves like \eqref{eqn:22-embedding}, then we obtain a topological circle and Vieta involutions tropicalize to give reflections on that circle. [Filip 2019](https://doi.org/10.3934/jmd.2019007), Figure 3.2.2, copied below, depicts such an idea.

![tropical-EC](/images/230412-fig4.png)

Although the 'geometric simplification' discussed above looks like a coincidence due to the shape of tori, what was discussed in [Filip 2019](https://doi.org/10.3934/jmd.2019007), Sec. 3 is somewhat opposite; it is the tropicalization that can systematically deal with such simplifications. In that regards, one can further study various algebraic actions in a geometric fashion, say as done in [Spalding and Veselov 2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=4421422) and [Filip 2019](https://doi.org/10.3934/jmd.2019007). Part of my thesis is based on the ideas of these previous works.
