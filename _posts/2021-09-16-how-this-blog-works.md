This 'web log' (etymology of 'blog,' as far as I know of) is intended to be a batch of notes that I make upon academic studies. 
Among the notes that I feel worth sharing, to be precise.

Some of the notes will be written in (math) English, while some else will be written in Korean (my mother tongue).
It is mostly due to the fact that I am bit uncomfortable to use English to represent convoluted ideas which is not math.

Every post will accompany the 'update log' below, to announce that some sort of revision is made after the first post.
