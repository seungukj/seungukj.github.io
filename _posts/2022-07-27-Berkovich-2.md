This series of posts is aimed to be a rudiment of the Berkovich line, a locally compact space that "fills up" a non-archimedean field $K$. This post continues from [part 1](/posts/2022/05/berkovich-line-1/).

# Previously

 * Fix a non-archimedean field $(K,\vert\cdot\vert_K)$ which is algebraically closed and Cauchy complete. Let $q>1$ be a number such that the valuation $v(\cdot)$ is evaluated $v(x)=-\log_q\vert x\vert_K$.
 * Given a $K$-algebra $A$, its *multiplicative seminorm* is a $K$-algebra seminorm $\vert\cdot\vert\colon A\to[0,\infty)$ such that $\vert fg\vert=\vert f\vert\cdot\vert g\vert$ holds. The *Berkovich spectrum* $\widehat{A}$ collects all multiplicative seminorms of $A$.

# More Multiplicative Seminorms of $K[T]$

We continue the discussions on the multiplicative seminorms of $K[T]$. Other than the **evaluation seminorms** $\vert f(T)\vert_a := \vert f(a)\vert$ (by $a\in K$), all such seminorms are multiplicative norms.

In the sequels, we assume that $\vert\cdot\vert_K$ is nondiscrete, in the sense that there exists $x\in K$ such that $\vert x\vert_K\neq 0,1$.

## Ball norms

According to **Berkovich classification theorem**, the building blocks of such norms are the sup norms on the balls. To elaborate, we denote

$$B(a,r) = \{x\in K : \vert x-a\vert_K\leq r\}$$

for closed balls (unlike the usual metric space convention, indeed). As a side note, we remark some interesting facts about these.

 > <b id="lem0">Proposition 1.</b> (1) Any point in a closed ball could be the center. (That is, for any $b\in B(a,r)$, $B(a,r)=B(b,r)$.)
 >
 > (2) Any two closed balls in $K$ are either nested or disjoint. (That is, for any two balls $B(a,r)$ and $B(b,s)$, with $r\leq s$, either $B(a,r)\cap B(b,s)=\varnothing$ or $B(a,r)\subset B(b,s)$.)

(Proof) (2) comes from (1) because if $B(a,r)\cap B(b,s)\neq\varnothing$, then I can replace centers of both balls to the intersection point. (1) follows from $\vert x-b\vert_K\leq\max(\vert x-a\vert_K,\vert b-a\vert_K)\leq r$ whenever $x,b\in B(a,r)$, showing $B(b,r)\subset B(a,r)$. As $a\in B(b,r)$, we can argue symmetrically.
<p style="text-align: right;">$\square$</p>

Define the **ball norm** (on $B(a,r)$) as

$$\vert f(T)\vert_{B(a,r)} := \sup_{x\in B(a,r)}\vert f(x)\vert_K.$$

Of course, this defines a $K$-algebra norm on $K[T]$, but it is nontrivial to see that this is a multiplicative norm. We state it as a

 > <b id="lem1">Theorem 2.</b> For $f,g\in K[T]$, we have $\vert fg\vert_{B(a,r)}=\vert f\vert_{B(a,r)}\vert g\vert_{B(a,r)}$.

This result is based on the following Lemma.

 > <b id="lem2">Lemma 3.</b> Write $f(T)\in K[T]$ as $f(T)=\sum_{i=0}^dc_i(T-a)^i$. Then we have
 > 
 > \begin{equation}\label{eqn:ball-norm-formula}\vert f(T)\vert_{B(a,r)} = \max\left(\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i : 0\leq i\leq d\right).\end{equation}

(Proof) If $x\in B(a,r)$, then $\vert f(x)\vert_K = \vert\sum_{i=0}^dc_i(x-a)^i\vert_K\leq\max_{i=0}^d\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot\vert x-a\vert_K^i\leq\max_{i=0}^d\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i$, so we have $$\vert f(T)\vert_{B(a,r)}\leq\max\{\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i : 0\leq i\leq d\}$$.

Because $r\mapsto\vert f(T)\vert_{B(a,r)}$ is an increasing function and $$r\mapsto\max\{\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i : 0\leq i\leq d\}$$ is a continuous function, it suffices to verify the equation \eqref{eqn:ball-norm-formula} for a dense set of $r\in[0,\infty)$. We need two ingredients to describe this dense set:

 * Denote $\vert K^\times\vert$ for the possible nonzero norm values of $K$. (Even for $$K=\mathbb{C}_p$$, this set is not equal to $$\mathbb{R}_{>0}=(0,\infty)$$, but equals to $p^{\mathbb{Q}}$.) Let $x\in K^\times$ be such that $\vert x\vert_K=:s\neq 0,1$. Then as $x^{p/q}\in K^\times$ for any $p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$, it follows that $s^{\mathbb{Q}}\subset\vert K^\times\vert$. So $\vert K^\times\vert\subset(0,\infty)$ is dense.
 * Denote $$S = \{r>0 : (\exists i,j)(i\neq j\text{ and }\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i=\vert c_j\vert_K\cdot r^j)\}$$. Then $S$ is a finite set.

We then show that for $r\in\vert K^\times\vert\setminus S$, we have \eqref{eqn:ball-norm-formula}. Because $r\in\vert K^\times\vert$, $r=\vert \epsilon\vert$ for some $\epsilon\in K$. As $r\notin S$, we have only one $0\leq i\leq d$ such that $$\vert c_i\epsilon^i\vert_K=\max\{\vert c_i\epsilon^i\vert_K : 0\leq i\leq d\}$$. Thus the inequality

$$\vert f(a+\epsilon)\vert_K = \left\vert\sum_{i=0}^dc_i\epsilon^i\right\vert_K\leq \max_{0\leq i\leq d}\vert c_i\epsilon^i\vert_K = \max_{0\leq i\leq d}\vert c_i\vert_K\cdot r^i$$

now becomes equality (by an axiom of nonarchimedean field norms). The equality \eqref{eqn:ball-norm-formula} follows.
<p style="text-align: right;">$\square$</p>

> <b id="lem2-1">Corollary.</b> For each polynomial $f(T)\in K[T]$ and $a\in K$, there is a finite set $S(f,a)\subset\vert K^\times\vert$ such that for each $r\in\vert K^\times\vert\setminus S(f,a)$, *any* $x\in K$ with $\vert x-a\vert_K=r$ has $\vert f(T)\vert_{B(a,r)}=\vert f(x)\vert_K$.

(Proof of <a href="#lem1" id="lem1-pf">**Theorem 2.**</a>) Set $S=S(f,a)\cup S(g,a)\cup S(fg,a)$. Then $S$ is finite, and for each $r\in\vert K^\times\vert\setminus S$, we have

$$\vert fg\vert_{B(a,r)} = \vert f(x)g(x)\vert_K = \vert f(x)\vert_K\vert g(x)\vert_K = \vert f\vert_{B(a,r)}\cdot\vert g\vert_{B(a,r)}.$$

For other $r>0$, appeal to the continuity of $r\mapsto\vert f\vert_{B(a,r)}$, etc., and that $\vert K^\times\vert\setminus S\subset[0,\infty)$ is dense.
<p style="text-align: right;">$\square$</p>

Although the proof above is quite elementary, it is far from capturing the complete sense that the theorem encodes. We will return to this later (in the [next post](/posts/2022/08/berkovich-line-3/#lem1-revisit), with the concept of *tropicalization*.

 > **Example.** [Previously](/posts/2022/05/berkovich-line-1/#gauss) we have defined a norm on $L=K(T)$ as follows. For $f\in K(T)$, write
 >
 > $$f(T) = a\cdot\frac{(T-x_1)(T-x_2)\ldots(T-x_n)}{(T-y_1)(T-y_2)\ldots(T-y_m)},$$

 > $$\vert f(T)\vert_L = \vert a\vert\cdot\frac{\max(1,\vert x_1\vert)\cdot \max(1,\vert x_2\vert)\cdots\max(1,\vert x_n\vert)}{\max(1,\vert y_1\vert)\cdot\max(1,\vert y_2\vert)\cdots\max(1,\vert y_m\vert)}.$$
 >
 > This norm is precisely the norm $\vert\cdot\vert_{B(0,1)}$ on $K[T]$ extended multiplicatively to $K(T)$. (Check: $\vert T-x\vert_{B(0,1)}=\max(\vert x\vert_K,1)$.) By this we have $\vert f+g\vert_L\leq\vert f\vert_L+\vert g\vert_L$, or even better, $\leq\max(\vert f\vert_L,\vert g\vert_L)$ (cf. [Proposition 4](#lem3)).

## Void intersection norms

Another class of norm rises from a nested family of balls in $K$, i.e.,

$$B:=\{B(a_1,r_1)\supset B(a_2,r_2)\supset\cdots\supset B(a_n,r_n)\supset\cdots\}.$$

For $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, such a sequence admits the *nonempty* total intersection $\bigcap B:=\bigcap_n B(a_n,r_n)$. But in the nonarchimedean case, the intersection may be empty.

 * Not all intersections are void for nonarchimedean cases, however. For instance, if the centers $(a_n)$ converge to $a$, then for $r=\inf_n r_n$, we have $\bigcap B=B(a,r)$.

 > **Example.** Let $K=\mathbb{C}_p$, for any prime $p$. Think of the balls
 >
 > $$B_n:=B(p^{-1/2}+p^{-1/4}+\cdots+p^{-1/2^{n-1}},p^{1/2^n})\subset K.$$
 >
 > One can then show that $B_{n+1}\subset B_n$ as follows. Let $a_n=p^{-1/2}+p^{-1/4}+\ldots+p^{-1/2^{n-1}}$, the center of the ball $B_n$. Then as $\vert a_{n+1}-a_n\vert_p=\vert p^{-1/2^n}\vert_p=p^{1/2^n}$, we have $a_{n+1}\in B_{n}\cap B_{n+1}$. As $p^{-1/2^{n+1}}<p^{-1/2^n}$, [Proposition 1](#lem0) applies.
 >
 > However, if there were any point $x\in\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B_n$, we must have $\vert a_{n+1}-a_n\vert_K\leq\vert x-a_{n+1}\vert_K+\vert x-a_n\vert_K<\frac12$ for $n$ big enough. This contradicts with $\vert a_{n+1}-a_n\vert_K=p^{-1/2^n}>1$.

Such a nested family of balls with void intersection defines a norm, in which I coin **void intersection norms**, defined as follows.

$$\vert f\vert_B := \lim_{n\to\infty}\vert f\vert_{B(a_n,r_n)}.$$

Indeed the limit on the right-hand side is always a decreasing limit, so the limit always exists. Multiplicative seminorm property trivially follows from those of ball norms on $B(a_n,r_n)$'s.

My understanding of this norm is that a nested family of balls with void intersection builds a "ghost ball" declared with a "ghost center $a=\lim_n a_n$" and a "ghost radius $r=\inf_nr_n$," and declares the ball norm on that ball. If we think of the so-called 'maximally complete extension' (cf. [Poonen 1993](http://dx.doi.org/10.5169/seals-60414), Cor. 5.6) of $K$, then one *can* realize this "ghost ball" as a ball in the extension; the ball norm in the extension then coincides with the void intersection norm. 

## Berkovich Classification Theorem

By far we have discovered the following types of multiplicative seminorms on $K[T]$:

 * Evaluation seminorms (i.e., $\vert f\vert_a:=\vert f(a)\vert_K$),
 * Ball norms with rational radii (i.e., $\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,r)}$ with $r\in\vert K^\times\vert$),
 * Ball norms with irrational radii (i.e., $\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,r)}$ with $r\notin\vert K^\times\vert$), and
 * Void intersection norms.

 > <b id="bct">Berkovich Classification Theorem.</b> The above four types of seminorms are all you get as multiplicative seminorms of $K[T]$, given a nonarchimedean, algebraically closed, Cauchy complete field $K$.

A proof can be found in ([Berkovich 1990](https://doi.org/10.1090/surv/033), Sec. 1.4.4), in which I brief as follows. Given a multiplicative seminorm $\vert\cdot\vert_x$, think of the family of balls $$B_x=\{B(a,\vert T-a\vert_x) : a\in K\}$$. This is a nested family, as followed by 

 > <b id="lem3">Proposition 4.</b> For any multiplicative seminorm $\vert\cdot\vert$ on a $K$-algebra $A$, where $(K,\vert\cdot\vert_K)$ is a nonarchimedean field, then the seminorm is nonarchimedean. That is, we have $\vert f+g\vert\leq\max(\vert f\vert,\vert g\vert)$ for any $f,g\in A$.

(Proof: [Baker & Rumely 2010](https://doi.org/10.1090/surv/159), Lem 1.1(C)) The punchline is, (1) for any integer $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, $\vert k\vert_K\leq 1$, and thus (2) by binomial theorem, $\vert f+g\vert^n\leq\sum_0^n\vert\binom{n}{j}\vert_K\cdot\vert f\vert^j\vert g\vert^{n-j}\lesssim n\cdot\max(\vert f\vert,\vert g\vert)^n$. Take the $n$-th root for (2) and send $n\to\infty$ to finish.
<p style="text-align: right;">$\square$</p>

So by [Proposition 4](#lem3), we have $\vert a-b\vert_K=\vert a-b\vert_x\leq\max(\vert T-a\vert_x,\vert T-b\vert_x)$. Hence if $\vert T-a\vert_x\leq\vert T-b\vert_x$, then balls $B(a,\vert T-a\vert_x)$ and $B(b,\vert T-b\vert_x)$ intersects at $a$, thus nested by [Proposition 1](#lem0). The intersection $\bigcap B_x$ is either empty (gives a void intersection norm) or nonempty (gives an evaluation or ball norm), and the classification follows.

# Berkovich Line

 > **Definition.** The *Berkovich line* $(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$ is the Berkovich spectrum of $K[T]$. That is, it is the space of multiplicative seminorms of $K[T]$.

Elements of the Berkovich line are classified as in [Berkovich classification theorem](#bct). Furthermore, the topology of this space is described in the following equivalent ways:

 * (By subbasic open sets) For each polynomial $f\in K[T]$ and an open interval $(\alpha,\beta)\subset\mathbb{R}$, define subbasic open sets of $(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$ as

 $$U(f,(\alpha,\beta))=\{x\in(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an} : \vert f\vert_x\in(\alpha,\beta)\}.$$

 * (By subspace topology) Think of the natural embedding $$(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}\subset\prod_{f\in K[T]}[0,\infty)$$, described below. Then $$(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$$ inherits subspace topology from the product space.

 $$\begin{array}{rl}
 (\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an} & \to \displaystyle\prod_{f\in K[T]}[0,\infty), \\[1.5em]
 x & \mapsto \left(\vert f\vert_x\right)_{f\in K[T]}.
 \end{array}$$

It is a simple exercise to actually show that evaluation seminorms give a *topological* embedding $K\subset(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$. Furthermore,

 > <b id="lem4">Proposition 5.</b> Evaluation seminorms $K\subset(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$ are dense.

(Proof) This follows from a general fact (cf. [Berkovich 1990](https://doi.org/10.1090/surv/033), Proposition 2.1.15) about Berkovich spectra, that Gel'fand spectrum is dense in the Berkovich spectrum. The proof I know depends on the theory of affinoid spaces. So instead I present a more elementary proof tailored for the Berkovich line.

By definition, any void intersection norm can be approximated by ball norms. By [Lemma 3](#lem2), any ball norm with irrational radii can be approximated by those with rational radii.

Finally, suppose we fix a neighborhood $\bigcap_{i=1}^kU(f_i,(\alpha_i,\beta_i))$ of a rational ball norm $\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,r)}$. By the [Corollary](#lem2-1) to Lem. 3, except for finite exceptional $r$'s, any $x\in K$ with $\vert x-a\vert_K=r$ has $\vert f_i\vert_{B(a,r)}=\vert f_i\vert_x$. So $\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,r)}$ is approximated by $\vert\cdot\vert_x$, for some $x\in K$. (For exceptional $r$, approximate to a non-exceptional $r'$ and continue.)
<p style="text-align: right;">$\square$</p>

In fact, evaluation seminorms can also be approximated by a ball norm: it holds that $\vert\cdot\vert_a\approx\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,\epsilon)}$, depending on the neighborhood specified. So *ball norms with rational radii* are also dense in $(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$.

## Visualization

Now we have a complete understanding of the Berkovich line $(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$ in an elementwise fashion. However, some simple topological observations admits us to visualize this 'line' as a tree with infinite valence. We list the observations below, and aim to sketch the Berkovich line visually.

Suppose $x=\vert\cdot\vert_{B(a,r)}$ and $y=\vert\cdot\vert_{B(b,s)}$ in $(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{an}$, where we admit $r=0$ or $s=0$. Thus $x,y$ represents a generic evaluation seminorm or ball norm. There we have a dichotomy:

 1. $B(a,r)\subset B(b,s)$.

In that case, we have $B(b,s)=B(a,s)$. Then one can build a (unique) path $x\to y$ by increasing the radii $r\to s$.

![nested-balls](/images/220727-nested-balls.png)

 2. $B(a,r)$ and $B(b,s)$ are disjoint.

In that case, we have $r,s<\vert a-b\vert$. Let $z=B(a,\vert a-b\vert)=B(b,\vert a-b\vert)$. Then one can build a (unique) path $x\to y$ by first going $x\to z$ by increasing the radii, then $z\to y$ by decreasing the radii.

![disjoint-balls](/images/220727-disjoint-balls.png)

If we continue this sketch for a variety of balls $B(a,r)$'s, we get the following picture. (Figure source: [M. Baker 2007](https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2007/BakerNotesMarch21.pdf), Figure 1.) In the figure, $\zeta_{\mathrm{Gauss}}:=\vert\cdot\vert_{B(0,1)}$.

![Berkovich-proj-line](/images/220727-berkovich-proj-line.png)

We observe many branches emitting from branch points, as well as a line that buds upwards from them. The lines bijectively correspond to $\mathbb{P}^1(\kappa)$, where $\kappa$ is the *residue field* of $K$: $\kappa:=\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{m}_K$ where

$$\mathcal{O}_K:=\{x\in K : v(x)\geq 0\}, \\
\mathfrak{m}_K:=\{x\in K : v(x)>0\}.$$

We further observe:

 * The points $a\in K$ lie at "endpoints."
 * The branching only occurs at balls with rational radii. At irrational radii, we can only go up/down.
 * Void intersection norms appear along some of the branches that *do not* go all the way to endpoints, but rather 'cauterized off' earlier.

![void-intersection-norm](/images/220727-cauterizing-off.png)

 * The balls $B(0,r)$'s are vertically connected from $\zeta_{\mathrm{Gauss}}$. Through these balls, we can access some endpoints $a\in K$ with $v(a)<0$. Furthermore, sending $r\to\infty$, we reach to the 'point at infinity,' $\infty$.

# Next

Next, we introduce the concept of tropicalization of a polynomial or a variety over a nonarchimedean field $K$ (although the notion may apply to archimedean fields as well). Based on that, one can introduce **Payne's tropicalization theorem** of Berkovich spectra, and even show it for Berkovich lines. Link to [part 3](/posts/2022/08/berkovich-line-3/)
