We discuss a construction question that naturally arises from the [Ax--Grothendieck theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax%E2%80%93Grothendieck_theorem). In particular, this comes from a field automorphism between the complex numbers and the ultraproduct of prime algebraically closed fields of positive characteristics.
