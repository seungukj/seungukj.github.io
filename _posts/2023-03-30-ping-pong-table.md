The famous [ping-pong lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-pong_lemma) gives us a way to show that a group is a free product of its subgroups. But what about the "other way around?"

Take a look at, say, the 3-fold free product $G=(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^{\ast 3}$ of order 2 groups. Then the topological action by the group is rather rigid, in the sense to be told below.

# Introduction

Recall the [ping-pong lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-pong_lemma):

 > **Theorem.** (Ping-pong Lemma) Let $G$ be a group and let $H_1,\ldots,H_k\leq G$ be subgroups, such that either
 >
 > * $k\geq 2$ and at least one of $H_i$ has order $\geq 3$, or
 > * $k\geq 3$ (and all $H_i$'s have order 2).
 >
 > Suppose the group $G\curvearrowright X$ acts on a set. Let $X_1,\ldots,X_k\subset X$ be disjoint nonempty subsets such that $h_j.X_i\subset X_j$ for all $h_j\in H_j\setminus(1)$. Then $G$ is a free product of $H_1,\ldots,H_k$.

 The essence of the proof is the formula

 $$h_{i(n)}\cdots h_{i(1)}.X_{i(0)}\subset X_{i(n)}, \label{eqn:ping-pong-general}$$
 
 where $i(0)\neq i(1)\neq i(2)\neq\cdots\neq i(n)$, and each $h_{i(j)}\in H_{i(j)}\setminus(1)$. That is, adjacent indices are different, including the 'initial spot' $X_{i(0)}$. After that is some combinatorial considerations on "how does reduced word look alike?"

 Suppose $G=(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^{\ast 3}$ is the 3-fold free product of order 2 groups. That is, this is the "most general" group generated by three involutions. Such a group appears in complex or tropical dynamics (see [El'-Huti 1974](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=342518), [Spalding & Veselov 2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=4421422), ...) and not only the group structure, but the way how this characterizes the space is interesting in the game.

 That is, we suggest a "reverse ping-pong question" as

 > **Question.** Suppose $G=H_1\ast\cdots\ast H_k$ is a free product and let $G\curvearrowright X$ acts with disjoint nonempty subsets $X_1,\ldots,X_k\subset X$ such that $h_j.X_i\subset X_j$ for all $h_j\in H_j\setminus(1)$.
 >
 > Suppose $G\curvearrowright Y$ carries subsets $Y_1,\ldots,Y_k$ with the same property. How similar are $X$ and $Y$?

 As I was working on complex dynamics for my thesis work, I will restrict my attention to the case $k=3$ and $H_1=H_2=H_3=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. 
 
 ## Statements

 The results are stated as follows.

 > **Definition.** (Ping-pong structure) Suppose $G=(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^{\ast 3}=\langle s_1,s_2,s_3\mid s_i^2=1\rangle$ and it acts $G\curvearrowright X$ on a topological space. If $X_1,X_2,X_3\subset X$ are disjoint open subsets such that
 >
 > 1. $s_i$ maps $X_i$ onto $X\setminus\overline{X}_i$, and
 > 2. the fixed set of $s_i$ is precisely the boundary $\partial X_i$.
 >
 > The triple of open subsets $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ is called the **ping-pong structure** of $G\curvearrowright X$.
 >
 > Call the ping-pong structure **fat** if $X\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3\overline{X}_i$ is nonempty, and **thin** if otherwise. For a fat ping-pong structure, define
 >
 > * $L_i = \partial X_i\setminus\bigcup_{j\neq i}\partial X_j$ (i.e., the part of boundary of $X_i$ that does not belong to that of other two),
 > * $X_0 = (X\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3\overline{X}_i)\cup\bigcup_{i=1}^3L_i$, the **ping-pong table**.

 Morally, the ping-pong table collects points in $X\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3X_i$ that has finite stabilizers.

 Given $G$-spaces with ping-pong structures, we compare them as follows.

 > **Theorem.** Suppose $G=(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^{\ast 3}$ and $G\curvearrowright X,Y$ acts on topological spaces. Suppose $X,Y$ has ping-pong structures $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ and $(Y_1,Y_2,Y_3)$ respectively.
 >
 > 1. Suppose the ping-pong structures on $X,Y$ are fat. Then any map $\psi\colon X_0\to Y_0$ between ping-pong tables extend to $\Psi\colon G.X_0\to G.Y_0$.
 > 2. Suppose $X,Y$ are circles, with $X_i$'s and $Y_i$'s being intervals. Suppose the intersections $\partial X_{i+1}\cap\partial X_{i+2}$ are singleton, $p_i$ denoting that point (and similarly $q_i=\partial Y_{i+1}\cap\partial Y_{i+2}$). If $$G.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}\subset X$$ and $$G.\{q_1,q_2,q_3\}\subset Y$$ are dense, then $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic as $G$-spaces.

# Fat Ping-pong Structure

 > **Lemma 1.** Suppose $X$ is a $G$-space with a fat ping-pong structure $(X_1,X_2,X_3;X_0)$. Any point of $X_0$ has the stabilizer group of order $\leq 2$. The subset $X_0\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^3\partial X_i$ is precisely the set of points $\in X_0$ that have nontrivial stabilizers.

 (Proof) Suppose $x\in X_0\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3\partial X_i$. Then for any nontrivial $g=  s_{i(n)}\cdots  s_{i(1)}\in G$, we have $x\in X\setminus\overline{X}_{i(1)}$, thus $g.x\in X_{i(n)}$ by \eqref{eqn:ping-pong-general}. Hence $g.x\notin X_0$, so $g$ cannot stabilize $x$.
 
 Suppose $x\in X_0\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^3\partial X_i$. We may assume that $x\in\partial X_1$. Suppose $g=  s_{i(n)}\cdots  s_{i(1)}\in G$ is nontrivial and $i(1)\neq 1$. Then we have $x\in X\setminus\overline{X}_{i(1)}$, thus $g.x\in X_{i(n)}\subset X\setminus X_0$ by \eqref{eqn:ping-pong-general}.

 So $g$ cannot stabilize $x$ unless $i(1)=1$. But even if $i(1)=1$, unless $g=  s_{i(1)}$, $g  s^{-1}_{i(1)}.x\notin X_0$ by the same reason above. Thus the stabilizer of $x$ is $\langle  s_1\rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. $\square$

 > **Lemma 2.** Suppose $X$ is a $ G$-space with a fat ping-pong structure $(X_1,X_2,X_3;X_0)$. The set $X_0\cup  s_i.X_0$ is a neighborhood of the ping-pong net $L_i=X_0\cap\overline{X}_i$.
 
 (Proof) Let $i=1$, without loss of generality. We know that $X\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3\overline{X}_i$ is the interior of $X_0$, and we denote that set $X_0^\circ$. The set $V=X_1\cup L_1\cup X_0^\circ$ then equals to $X\setminus(\overline{X}_2\cup\overline{X}_3)$ and is thus an open neighborhood of $L_1$.

 Next, the set $F=X_1\setminus  s_1.X_0^\circ$ is a closed subset of $X_1$ which is a subset of $  s_1.(\overline{X}_2\cup\overline{X}_3)$. Since $  s_1.L_1=L_1$ is disjoint with $  s_1.(\overline{X}_2\cup\overline{X}_3)$, the set $V\setminus F$ is an open neighborhood of $L_1$. We evaluate

 $$ V\setminus F = (X_1\cup L_1\cup X_0^\circ)\setminus(X_1\setminus  s_1.X_0^\circ) \\
        = L_1\cup X_0^\circ\cup  s_1.X_0^\circ, $$

and we see that this is a subset of $X_0\cup s_1.X_0$. The claim is shown. $\square$

 > **Lemma 3.** Suppose $X$ is a $ G$-space with a fat ping-pong structure $(X_1,X_2,X_3;X_0)$. The action map $A\colon G\times X_0\to G.X_0$. is a quotient map.
 
 (Proof) Suppose $U\subset G.X_0$ is a subset whose preimage $A^{-1}(U)\subset G\times X_0$ is open. We aim to show that $U\subset G.X_0$ is open.

  Note that $X_0\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^3\partial X_i$ is precisely the interior $X_0^\circ$ of $X_0$. By Lemma \ref{lem:cayley-observations}, if we restrict $A$ to $ G\times X_0^\circ$, then the action map is a homeomorphism onto the image $ G.X_0^\circ$. Thus if $U\subset G.X_0^\circ$, $A^{-1}(U)$ is open iff $U$ is open.

  Suppose $U$ intersects $ G.(X_0\setminus X_0^\circ)$ at $g.x_0$. Switching to $g^{-1}.U$ if necessary, we may assume $g=1$. From $X_0\setminus X_0^\circ=\bigcup_{i=1}^3\partial X_i$, we may assume $x_0\in\partial X_1$. We aim to show that $U$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ (in $ G.X_0$).

  Because $A^{-1}(x_0)=\{(1,x_0),(  s_1,x_0)\}$ by **Lemma 1.**, we see that the open set $A^{-1}(U)$ is a neighborhood of this preimage. Thus there is a neighborhood $U'$ of $x_0$ in $X_0$ such that $\{1,  s_1\}\times U'\subset A^{-1}(U)$. As $A$ is surjective, $U'\cup  s_1.U'\subset U$ follows. Hence it suffices to see if $U'\cup  s_1.U'$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ in $ G.X_0$ (to prove that $U$ itself is open).

  Suppose otherwise. Recall that $X_0\cup  s_1.X_0$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ in $X$ and in $ G.X_0$ (**Lemma 2.**). For every neighborhood $V\subset X_0\cup  s_1.X_0$ of $x_0$ in $ G.X_0$, $  s_1.V$ is also a neighborhood of $x_0$. Thus $V\cap  s_1.V$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ as well. Because $x_0$ is not on the interior of $U'\cup  s_1.U'$ in $ G.X_0$ we have an element $y_V\in V\cap  s_1.V$ such that $y_V\notin U'\cup  s_1.U'$. Here, we may set $y_V\in X_0$, by replacing $y_V\leftarrow  s_1.y_V$ if necessary. But as $U'$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ in $X_0$, $y_V\in U'$ if $V$ gets small enough. This contradicts. $\square$

Now we prove the first part of the main theorem. Denote the action maps $A\colon G\times X_0\to G.X_0$ and $A'\colon G\times Y_0\to G.Y_0$, which are quotient maps. We aim to build a map $\Psi\colon G.X_0\to G.Y_0$ which has the following commutative relation:

$$G\times X_0\xrightarrow{A}G.X_0\overset{\Psi}{\dashrightarrow}G.Y_0 = G\times X_0\xrightarrow{1\times\psi}G\times Y_0\xrightarrow{A'}G.Y_0.$$

  Because $A$ is a quotient map, if we know $A(g,x_0)=A(g',x_0)$ implies $A'(g,\psi(x_0))=A'(g,\psi(x_1))$, then the map $\Psi$ is constructed the universal property. Suppose $A(g,x_0)=A(g',x_1)$, i.e., $g.x_0=g'.x_1$. By **Lemma  1.**, we have $x_0=x_1$ and $(g')^{-1}g$ stabilizes $x_0$. Because $\psi$ respects `ping-pong nets,' $(g')^{-1}g$ also fixes $\psi(x_0)$. Therefore $A'(g,\psi(x_0))=A'(g',\psi(x_1))$. $\blacksquare$

# Circular Ping-pong Structure

Recall the ping-pong structure $X_i$'s and common boundary points $p_i=\partial X_{i+1}\cap\partial X_{i+2}$.

Note that the indexing convention of $p_i$'s implies $$\partial X_1=\{p_2,p_3\}$$, $$\partial X_2=\{p_1,p_3\}$$, and $$\partial X_3=\{p_1,p_2\}$$. By this convention, one can describe the stabilizer of $p_i$ as the subgroup generated by $$\{ s_1, s_2, s_3\}\setminus\{ s_i\}$$. Furthermore, ping-pong nets $p_i$ are not in the orbit of another.

 > **Lemma 4.** If $w.p_i=p_j$, then $i=j$ and $w$ is in the stabilizer of $p_i$.
 
 (Proof) Write $w$ in the reduced word, $w= s_{i(n)}\cdots s_{i(1)}$. If $i(1)\neq i$, then as $ s_{i(1)}$ stabilizes $p_i$, we reduce the letter and get a shorter $w$. Continue on, until we reach to $w=1$ (thus the conclusion) or we have $w\neq 1$ with the rightmost letter $ s_{i(1)}= s_i$.

Because $p_i\in X\setminus\overline{X}_i$, we have $ s_{i}.p_i\in X_i$. Together with $ s_j.X_i\subset X_j$ if $i\neq j$, we have $w.p_i\in X_{i(n)}$. But as $p_j\notin X_{i(n)}$, we have a contradiction. $\square$



Denote $ \vert \cdot \vert $ for the word length of the group $ G$ with respect to the generators $ s_1, s_2, s_3$. Denote $ G_{\leq n}$ for the set of words $w\in G$ with word length $ \vert w \vert \leq n$. We say $w'$ is a *left (right) subword* of $w$ if we have $w=w'w''$ ($w=w''w'$) for some reduced word $w''$ with length $ \vert w \vert - \vert w' \vert $.

We fix an orientation of $X$ and for $a,b\in X$, denote $[a,b]$ ($(a,b)$) for the closed (open) interval obtained by starting from $a$, go along the orientation, and end at $b$. In particular, we have $[a,b]\cup[b,a]=X$ unless $a=b$. For a finite subset $S=\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\}\subset X$, we say $s_i$ is *adjacent* to $s_j$ if one of the open intervals $(s_i,s_j)$ or $(s_j,s_i)$ does not contain any other point in $S$. Because each $ s_i$ acts as reflections, it preserves intervals (flipping the endpoints) and adjacency (on $ s_i.S$). As $ s_i$ filps endpoints, we introduce a notation $-[a,b]=[b,a]$ for flipping an interval.

Consider the partial orbit $P_n =  G_{\leq n}.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ of ping-pong nets. This is a finite set of points in $X$ that "partitions" $X$ by closed intervals. We will call these intervals *partition intervals by $P_n$*.

 > **Lemma 5.** Let $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
 >
 > 1. There are $3\cdot 2^n$ points in $P_n$.
 > 1. Let $w'.p_j,w''.p_k\in P_n$ be adjacent points, where rightmost letters of $w',w''$ are $ s_j, s_k$ respectively. Then either $w'$ is a left subword of $w''$ or vice versa. If $w'$ is a subword of $w''$, then $(w')^{-1}w''$ stabilizes $p_j$.
 > 1. Any partition interval by $P_n$ has an endpoint in $P_n\setminus P_{n-1}$ and another in $P_{n-1}$.

 That is, the partitions by $P_n$ strictly refines that of $P_{n-1}$, for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$, and each partition interval by $P_{n-1}$ contains a unique point in $P_n\setminus P_{n-1}$.

(Proof) First, note that partition intervals of $P_0=\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ are precisely $\overline{X}_1,\overline{X}_2,\overline{X}_3$ and each interval has endpoints in $P_0$.

We induct on $n$. For $n=1$, we observe that $ s_i.p_i\in X_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. In particular, each $ s_i.p_i$ cuts the interval $\overline{X}_i$ into two pieces. Hence $P_1$ adds three more points from $P_0$, any adjacent points in $P_1$ must have a form $p_j$ and $ s_k.p_k$ with $k\neq j$, and any partition interval has endpoints from $P_1\setminus P_0$ and $P_0$.

Suppose we have the claims 1. to 3. for all $n\leq m$. For any $w.p_i\in P_m\setminus P_{m-1}$, write $w= s_{i(m)}\cdots s_{i(1)}$ with $i(1)=i$. Then we have two choices of $ s_j$ with $j\neq i(m)$. We claim that $ s_jw.p_i\notin P_m$.

If otherwise, we have $ s_jw.p_i=w'.p_k$ for some $w'\in G_{\leq m}$. By **Lemma 4.**, we must have $k=i$ and $w^{-1} s_jw'$ is in the stabilizer of $p_i$. But if the leftmost letter of $w^{-1} s_jw'$ is still $ s_{i(1)}= s_i$, then the word cannot stabilize $p_i$; so $ s_jw'$ must cancel all letters of $w^{-1}$. Since $j\neq i(m)$, $ s_j$ must cancel the leftmost letter of $w'$. But then $\vert s_jw'\vert<m$ and we have $w.p_i= s_jw'.p_i\in P_{m-1}$, which contradicts.

Hence we obtain two new points for each element of $P_m\setminus P_{m-1}$. As $ \vert P_m\setminus P_{m-1} \vert =3\cdot 2^{m-1}$, we obtain $3\cdot 2^m$ new points in $P_{m+1}$, proving 1.

Now we prove 2. Let $w'.p_j,w''.p_k\in P_{m+1}$ be adjacent, and rightmost letters of $w',w''$ are $ s_j, s_k$ respectively. If any of $w'$ or $w''$ is trivial, then we are done. Suppose $w',w''\neq 1$ and the leftmost letter of $w'$ and $w''$ are distinct, say $ s_1$ and $ s_2$ respectively. Then we have $w'.p_j\in X_1$ and $w''.p_k\in X_2$. Because $p_3$ or $p_1$ is a point in $P_{m+1}$ that can lie between these points, $w'.p_j$ and $w''.p_k$ are not adjacent. Hence $w',w''$ share the leftmost letters, say $ s_1$. Then $ s_1^{-1}w'.p_j, s_1^{-1}w''.p_k\in P_m$ are adjacent, so we invoke the induction hypothesis to prove 2.

We prove 3. Suppose $[w'.p_j,w''.p_k]$ is a partition interval by $P_{m+1}$. We may set the rightmost letter of $w',w''$ are $ s_j, s_k$ respectively. By 2., we may assume that $w'$ is a left subword of $w''$, and $(w')^{-1}w''$ stabilizes $p_j$. Hence $w'.p_j=w'(w')^{-1}w''.p_j=w''.p_j$ follows.

Note that $w'.p_j$ and $w''.p_k$ are adjacent in the subset $w''.P_{m+1- \vert w'' \vert }$. Thus $p_j,p_k$ are adjacent in $P_{m+1- \vert w'' \vert }$. But then $m+1- \vert w'' \vert $ must be 0; otherwise we can pick $ s_i.p_i$ between $p_j,p_k$ (where $i\neq j,k$). Thus $ \vert w'' \vert =m+1$ and $w''.p_k\in P_{m+1}\setminus P_m$. Since $w'\neq w''$ (compare the rightmost letters), $ \vert w' \vert < \vert w'' \vert =m+1$ follows and $w'.p_j\in P_m$. This proves 3. $\square$

What was argued in the proof of 3. gives rise to a

 > **Corollary.** If $\pm[w'.p_j,w''.p_k]$ is a partition interval by $P_n$ with $w''.p_k\in P_n\setminus P_{n-1}$, then for the 3rd index $i\neq j,k$, we have $\pm[w'.p_j,w''.p_k]=w''.\overline{X}_i$.
 >
 > Furthermore, the interval $\pm[w'.p_j,w''.p_k]$ has the unique intersection with $P_{n+1}\setminus P_n$ at $w'' s_i.p_i$.

 (Proof) For the latter claim, we note that $ s_i.p_i\in X_i$, so on the open interval $\pm(w'.p_j,w''.p_k)=w''.X_i$ we have $w'' s_i.p_i$ in that interval. So each partition interval by $P_n$ has at least one element of $P_{n+1}\setminus P_n$. As there are $3\cdot 2^n$ parititon intervals by $P_n$ and $3\cdot 2^n$ elements in $P_{n+1}\setminus P_n$, uniqueness follows from counting. $\square$

Recall that a metric $d_X$ on $X=S^1$ is *intrinsic* if $d_X(x,x')$ equals to the infimum of lengths of all paths from $x$ to $x'$. Then it is natural to define the *total length* $L_X$ of $X$, which is the intrinsic length of the circle $X$. In that case, one can measure the length $\mathsf{length}(I)$ of an interval $I=[a,b]$ by either $d_X(a,b)$ or $L_X-d_X(a,b)$, depending on the orientation.

In particular, the lengths of partition intervals of $P_n$'s sum to $L_X$. Hence we have

$$\delta_X(n) := \inf\{\mathsf{length}(I) : I\text{ is a partition interval by }P_n\}\leq\frac{L_X}{3\cdot 2^n}.$$

Analogously, define

$$\Delta_X(n) := \sup\{\mathsf{length}(I) : I\text{ is a partition interval by }P_n\}.$$

Just like $\delta_X(n)$ had a clear $o(1)$ bound, $\Delta_X(n)$ may have such a bound. However, to guarantee so, we need some additional condition.

> **Lemma 6.** If $$G.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$$ is dense in $X$, then $\Delta_X(n)$ is $o(1)$ as $n\to\infty$.

(Proof) Suppose otherwise. Then as $\Delta_X(n)$ is decreasing in $n$, there is $c>0$ such that $\Delta_X(n)\geq c$ for all $n$. Let $I_n$ be a partition interval by $P_n$ with length $\geq c$.

Let $x_n$ be the (intrinsic) midpoint of $I_n$. Let $x$ be a limit point of the sequence $(x_n)$. We may assume that $d_X(x,x_n)<\frac14c$, so that $x$ has distance $>\frac14c$ from boundaries of $I_n$. Thus there is an interval $I$ of center $x$ and radius $\frac14c$ which is contained in infinitely many $I_n$'s.

In that case, $I$ cannot intersect any $P_n$. This is because if $I\subset I_{n_k}^\circ$ (interior), then for that $n_k$, $I$ does not intersect $P_{n_k}$. As $n_k$'s can be arbitrarily large, the claim follows. Thus the density fails. $\square$

Now we are ready to prove the theorem for the circle.

We first define a map $$f\colon G.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}\to G.\{q_1,q_2,q_3\}$$ by $f(w.p_i)=w.q_i$. This map is well-defined because the stabilizer of $p_i$ and $f(p_i)=q_i$ coincide.

The map $f$ preserves the cyclic order, in the following sense. Recall $$P_n= G_{\leq n}.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$$. If $w'.p_j$ and $w''.p_k$ are adjacent points in $P_n$, then $w'.q_j$ and $w''.q_k$ are also adjacent in $$Q_n= G_{\leq n}.\{q_1,q_2,q_3\}.$$

We prove this claim, inductively on $n$. For $n=0$, this is obvious. Assume the claim for $n\geq 0$. If $w'.p_j$ and $w''.p_k$ are adjacent points in $P_{n+1}$, with $w''.p_k\in P_{n+1}\setminus P_n$, then there is a word $w$ in the stabilizer of $p_j$ such that (a) $w'.p_j$ and $w'w.p_i$ (where $i\neq j,k$) are adjacent in $P_n$, and (b) $w''.p_k=w'w s_k.p_k$. By induction hypothesis and (a), $w'.q_j$ and $w'w.q_i$ are adjacent in $Q_n$. By Corollary \ref{eqn:origin-of-partition-interval}, $w'w s_k.q_k=w''.q_k$ is adjacent to $w'.q_j$ in $Q_{n+1}$. This clears the induction step.

Next, we show that $f$ is uniformly continuous (with the metrics $d_X$ and $d_Y$). Denote $L_X$ and $L_Y$ for the total lengths of $X$ and $Y$ respectively, and let $0<c<1$ be the common contraction rate for $d_X$ and $d_Y$. Recall that $P_n= G_{\leq n}.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$, and recall the quantities $\delta_X(n)$ and $\Delta_Y(n)$.

Fix $n>0$. We show that, whenever $x,x'\in G.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$,

$$ \label{eqn:uniformly-continuous-estimate}
  d_X(x,x')<\delta_X(n)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad d_Y(f(x),f(x'))\leq 2\Delta_Y(n).$$

If $d_X(x,x')<\delta_X(n)$, we have adjacent points $x_0,x_1,x_2\in P_n$ (in that cyclic order) such that the parititon intervals $[x_0,x_1]\cup[x_1,x_2]$ contains both $x,x'$. Same property holds for the intervals $[f(x_0),f(x_1)]\cup[f(x_1),f(x_2)]$ and points $f(x),f(x')$. Because $\pm[f(x),f(x')]$ is a subinterval of $[f(x_0),f(x_2)]$, we estimate

$$ d_Y(f(x),f(x')) \leq d_Y(f(x_0),f(x_2)) \\
  = d_Y(f(x_0),f(x_1))+d_Y(f(x_1),f(x_2)) \leq 2\Delta_Y(n), $$

by the definition of $\Delta_Y(n)$. This shows the implication \eqref{eqn:uniformly-continuous-estimate}, which leads to the uniform continuity of our interest.
    
By dense net orbits condition, the extension reaches to $f\colon X\to Y$. For any $x\in X$ and $g\in G$, fix a sequence $(x_n)$ in $ G.\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ that converges to $x$. Then $f(g.x):=\lim_{n\to\infty}f(g.x_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}g.f(x_n)=g.f(x)$ verifies that $f$ is $ G$-equivariant. Because we can construct $f^{-1}$ by the same way, we also see that $f$ is a homeomorphism. $\square$
