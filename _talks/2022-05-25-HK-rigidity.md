## Abstract

Dynamical systems that have volume-class measures of maximal entropy typically have locally homogeneous structures. In complex dynamics, this usually means that the automorphism comes from a torus, as established by Zdunik, Berteloot--Dupont, Cantat--Dupont, Filip--Tosatti, and others. As a successor to this series, we present another result that applies to projective hyperkahler manifolds, a higher-dimensional analogue of K3 surfaces.

We discuss how such a system has a surprisingly simple dynamical structure, and how we can make use of  this structure to identify the given automorphism as a "Kummer example" with a (Ricci-flat) flat metric. All the necessary background will be provided.
