### Abstract

We show that a holomorphic automorphism on a projective hyperk채hler manifold that has positive topological entropy and has volume measure as the measure of maximal entropy, is necessarily a Kummer example, partially extending the analogous results in (Cantat-Dupont 2020)(Filip-Tosatti 2018) for complex surfaces.

A trick with Jensen's inequality is used to show that stable and unstable distributions exhibit uniform rate of contraction and expansion, and with them our hyperk채hler manifold is shown to be flat. A recent result in (Claudon-Graf-Guenancia-Naumann 2020) then implies that our hyperk채hler manifold is birational to a torus quotient, giving the Kummer example structure.
