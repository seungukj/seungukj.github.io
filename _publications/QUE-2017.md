### Abstract
We prove that the Hecke-Maass eigenforms for a compact arithmetic triangle group have a growing number of nodal domains as the eigenvalue tends to \\(+\infty\\). More generally the same is proved for eigenfunctions on negatively curved surfaces that are even or odd with respect to a geodesic symmetry and for which quantum unique ergodicity holds.
